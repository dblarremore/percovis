These source code files require Qt to build a gui, and should be able to be compiled using the commands in the compilation script. 

That having been said, I wrote this code when I was a grad student, trying all of this out for the first time, with no idea how to actually write good code, build a project, and so on. Frankly, I still don't know. I hope that this is useful. Surely, there are many ways to make this run far, far more efficiently!
